# MachineLearning

In this repository, hard-coded machine learning code in Python will be listed.

## Weekly Lab 1
### Data Set Chosen: Abalone from UCI

Lab 1 is a simple visualization of the data set. Several scatter plots are listed

## Weekly Lab 2
### Data Set Chosen: Abalone from UCI

Lab 2 is a clustering and classification of the data set. In given code, a K-means
algorithm is hard-coded and a 2-D graph is plotted as showing difference between
iterations


## Project Milestone 1
### Combine Weekly Lab 1 and Weekly Lab 2

No additional Modifications

## Project Milestone 2
### Implemented hard-coded feature extraction on given data set

In Milestone 2, we are given two datasets, one represents the fetal heart rate and
the other uterine contractions. We are asked to perform feature extraction on these
datasets by specific requirements-baseline, variability, acceleration and deceleration.


## Final Project
### Implemented a CNN for written digit recognition with a calculator

In the final project, we design a simple calculator with addition/subtraction/
multiplication/division operations. The calculator allows user input of written digits.
The idea of recognizing written input is to training a classifier based on the MNIST dataset.
With the help of scipy for trianing and Pygame for GUI, we realize all the functionalities
we wanted
